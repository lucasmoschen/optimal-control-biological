## About The Project

The objective of this project is to introduce the basic concepts of Optimum
Control: existence of solution, Pontryagin Maximum Principle and Dynamic 
Programming Principle. We intend to study different formulations of a control problem, 
examples of problems in real life, specially with biologic applications and
basic theoretical results. The main reference of the the project was the book
[Optimal Control Applied to Biological
Models](https://www.routledge.com/Optimal-Control-Applied-to-Biological-Models/Lenhart-Workman/p/book/9781584886402#:~:text=Optimal%20Control%20Applied%20to%20Biological%20Models%20thoroughly%20develops%20the%20mathematical,this%20theory%20to%20biological%20models.&text=In%20addition%2C%20the%20authors%20introduce,partial%20differential%20equations%20(PDEs).).

This repository contais the studied topics in my Scientific Initiation in the topic. It's based on the book written by Suzanne Lenhart and John T. Workman called Optimal Control Applied to Biological Models. So it was written notes in notes using this reference in portuguese so as to be a initial reference in the language. It was also developed in notebooks all the laboratories studied in these notes.

A class in optimal_control_class.py file was developed to deal with all laboratories, no need to worry with the code, initially. This code contains the famous method in the area called forward-backward sweep.

In order to use this to your problem, you need to specify:

Differential equations of the state variables.
Differential equations of the adjoint functions, calculated by the necessary conditions.
A characterization of the optimal control calculation.
You can also specify bounds if necessary and when the payoff term is linear, one can pass it as a function. The parameters of the model are dealt as a dictionary, except the final time and initial condition of the states, that are separated. These last two parameters are necessary. The notebooks 2, 3, 7, 12 and 13 can be a good reference to start its usage.
