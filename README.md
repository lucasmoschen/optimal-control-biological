## About The Project

The objective of this project is to introduce the basic concepts of Optimum
Control: existence of solution, Pontryagin Maximum Principle and Dynamic 
Programming Principle. We intend to study different formulations of a control problem, 
examples of problems in real life, specially with biologic applications, and
basic theoretical results. The main reference of the the project was the book written by Suzanne Lenhart and John T. Workman called
[Optimal Control Applied to Biological
Models](https://www.routledge.com/Optimal-Control-Applied-to-Biological-Models/Lenhart-Workman/p/book/9781584886402#:~:text=Optimal%20Control%20Applied%20to%20Biological%20Models%20thoroughly%20develops%20the%20mathematical,this%20theory%20to%20biological%20models.&text=In%20addition%2C%20the%20authors%20introduce,partial%20differential%20equations%20(PDEs).).

Notes were produced on the subject in book form written in portuguese language, in order to serve as a reference in this language to start the studies in this topic. 

[[Download the book here]](https://github.com/lucasmoschen/Optimal_Control_Biological/blob/master/notes/book.pdf)

It was also developed in notebooks all the laboratories studied in these notes. For these simulation, *Python Programming Language* associated with *Jupyter Notebook* was used, because of its easy usage and aimple interpretation. A class in `optimal_control_class.py` file was designed to deal with all laboratories, no need to worry with the code, initially. This code contains the famous method in the area called forward-backward sweep.

### Built With

One will need these frameworks to 

* [Latex](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
